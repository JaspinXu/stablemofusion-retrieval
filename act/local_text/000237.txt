a stick figure's arms are moving up and down  
a stick figure takes a step to the far left
the person moves both their arms in a frontwards circular motion  
the person does a twisting motion like a doorknob  
a figure brings their right and left arms up, bent, as if cradling their face
a stick figure drops their right arm down towards their left leg  
they jump
someone brings both hands back down to their sides
