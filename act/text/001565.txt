A person lowers their arms and bends their knees while arching the back; then, still feeling confused, he brings his curled fingers close to his neck and stands still as his left hand swings lightly for a second. This thinking stance lasts only for a moment before he raises his curled hand over his neck and quickly reopens it. Following that notion, he takes big steps to pick up an item that appears low to the ground, then turns around and begins to sweep the floor.
