A person slightly raises both arms while adjusting his hips to be angled between the gaps of the arms. Next, he pulls his arms back and moves his hips forward, then adjusts to have the opposite arm in front and aligns his hips accordingly. Following that, he repeats the process of pulling his arms back and pushing his hips forward, before ultimately lifting an object up to his face using his right arm.
