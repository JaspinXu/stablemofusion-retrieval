A person steps back at an angle with the left side back the farthest and both hands slightly raised; then, they slightly bend over and shuffle several times with the left foot moving first, traversing the space, and ultimately coming to a stop, facing the same way they started. Next, they walk briskly downwards in a slightly angled path before stopping again.
