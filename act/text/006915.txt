An individual is dropping their arms down to their sides from a "t" position, then with their left hand, reaches right and back to the left. Following that, they lift their left hand up and then down, moving it forward and back to their body. Subsequently, the upper body turns quickly to the right, causing the arms to bounce from the movement.
