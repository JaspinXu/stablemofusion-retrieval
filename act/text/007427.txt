A person runs sideways to the right, then to the left, and then back towards the center. Following that, the figure jumps and lands with its arms and legs spread. Subsequently, it jumps again, returning its legs to their original position while raising its arms in the air. After that, it jumps once more, returning to the spread-out position, and this time it lands in a squatting position with its arms still held out. Finally, it jumps again, holding its arms back up in the air.
