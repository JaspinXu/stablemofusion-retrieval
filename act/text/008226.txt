A person begins by hopping on one foot with their arms outstretched, then alternates by hopping on the other foot. Following that, a man stands with his feet shoulder-width apart and starts jogging in place, taking turns raising his feet one at a time while lifting his arms one at a time. After that, he stops and returns to the same position in which he started.
