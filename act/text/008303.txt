A person is facing front and then takes a step backwards before swinging their left leg out in front while twirling their body to the left sided position. Following that, they proceed to use the left leg to go right back to the front position. Next, the figure takes a few steps forward and performs a quick spin (180 degrees) on their right heel while swaying as they step out of the turn.
