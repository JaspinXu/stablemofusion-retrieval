A person stands on one leg, with the other leg bent at the knee and held high to the left. Then, they move the bent leg to the front and extend the lower leg. Following that, the person brings their left and right arms to the sides to make a scratching motion. After that, the arms move up to the head to scratch both sides, with the left arm finishing the scratching motion first, followed by the right arm.
