A man walks forward while balancing himself, then walks to the right. After that, he begins to sit cross-legged by leaning forward and rightward, putting his right leg behind his left and lowering his body toward the ground with his bent left support leg. As his right arm reaches down to support his body and his left hand starts to assist in maintaining the full sitting position, he pauses before reversing the action to stand back up.
