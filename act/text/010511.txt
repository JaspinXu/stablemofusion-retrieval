A person remains stationary while lowering his arms to his sides, then brings them forward with elbows bent as if holding an invisible steering wheel. Following that, he returns his arms to a relaxed position at his side. Subsequently, a man jumps three times, each time gradually increasing the intensity and reaching greater height after each jump.
