A person stands with their hands raised high, then drops them and jumps in place. Following that, they climb up five steps while reaching to their left and touching something with their left hand. Subsequently, the figure takes a step forward, picks up an object with their left hand, and staggers, causing them to turn on their heel counterclockwise in a full circle.
