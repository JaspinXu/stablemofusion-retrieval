A person walks forward and does a cartwheel, but almost falls; then, they walk in a half-circle. Following that, they stand with their legs spread shoulder-width apart and their arms out and bent at the elbows. Subsequently, the person moves their right hand up into a straight pose, parallel with their chest.
