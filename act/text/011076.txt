A man kicks his right leg in the air behind him while leaning forward, then drops it back down to the floor. Following that, he kicks his left leg up in the air behind him, again leaning forward before letting it back down. Afterward, a person makes a twisting motion with their right hand towards the ground, then takes a step backwards and raises both hands up, holding them out to their sides.
