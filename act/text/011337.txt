A person first makes a standing hop onto his left foot, then hops again onto both feet, followed by a hop onto his right foot, then back onto both feet. After making a short hop with his left foot, he settles his right foot on the floor. Subsequently, he walks forward, quickly stumbles to the right, and then back to the left.
