A person stands with their right arm raised up to the side and their left arm slightly lower; then they put their left arm down to their groin. Following that, they raise both arms up with elbows slightly bent. Subsequently, the figure turns and runs to the right, then turns again and runs to the left, moving in a figure-eight pattern.
