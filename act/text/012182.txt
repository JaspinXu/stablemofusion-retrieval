A person cartwheels diagonally to his forward right, then stumbles to stand straight a bit after landing. Subsequently, he walks back to his original position while stretching out his arms, lowering them back down. Following that, his right arm touches his left shoulder across the chest, then the right hand is placed at the top of his neck and down the chest area before pointing outward and returning to the original position.
