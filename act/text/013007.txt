A man makes straight punches with his left hand while torquing his fist and waist simultaneously to generate force twice. Then, he turns to his left and repeats the same action. After that, he finishes with crossing his left leg over his right leg while standing in position. Following that, a person waves back and forth with both arms overhead.
