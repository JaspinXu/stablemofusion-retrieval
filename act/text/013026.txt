A person is standing upright with legs slightly bent and both arms stretched outward, then they stretch their arms out in a T shape while balancing on their left leg with their right leg behind. Subsequently, both arms drop to the side while the body slightly rocks left and right for six seconds, before returning both arms to the stretched outward position.
