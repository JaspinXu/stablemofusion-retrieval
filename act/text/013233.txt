A person sidesteps to the left, then to the right and back to the left, as if they were working out. Following that, a man drops his arms suddenly, then raises them more slowly along with his back. Afterwards, he holds his arms out and brings them near his chest, before raising his right arm to pound at the air in front of him several times.
