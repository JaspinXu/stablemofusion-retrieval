A man drops his arms suddenly and then raises them more slowly along with his back. Following that, he holds his arms out and near his chest, then raises his right arm to pound at the air in front of him several times. Subsequently, he gets up from the ground, crouches, puts his left hand on his head, takes it down, and stands up.
