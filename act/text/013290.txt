A person walks forward and to the left with a large step, arms held close to their body and hands out like claws, resembling a dinosaur. Then, they step forward two more steps, reaching their right hand down to grab something. Subsequently, they slice it with their other hand while holding it down with their right hand before stepping back to their original position.
