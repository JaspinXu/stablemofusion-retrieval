A person spins their arms around in a circular motion before switching them into an extended stretching motion. Then, a dancer with arms raised and spread steps away from the viewer, gracefully bowing and subsequently raising their right arm. Following that, they lift both arms and perform ballet steps, including a single pirouette and a leg dip, as they ascend a ramp.
