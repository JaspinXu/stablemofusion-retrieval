A person holds their hands up to shoulder height and then puts them down. Following that, they bring their hands up again to push something to the left-hand side. Next, they raise both hands as if holding an instrument before putting them down once more. Meanwhile, a man is trying to balance on his left foot but ultimately loses his balance.
