A person who is standing with his arms out from his sides gets pushed from behind, then turns and runs to his right. After that, he does a 180-degree turn and runs to his left. Following that, he performs another 180-degree turn, runs to his right again, and does yet another 180-degree turn before running to his left. Finally, he stops mid-way and resumes his standing position.
