A person first side steps to the left and then to the right while facing forward. Following that, they view their phone in their hand and use a sliding motion with their finger to answer a phone call. They then hold the phone up against their face, slightly rotating clockwise and counterclockwise while switching their weight from one side to the other during the conversation, perhaps feeling irritable. After the conversation, they drop their arm and hold the phone for a brief moment before putting it back into their pocket. Subsequently, they withdraw the phone out of their pocket to look at an incoming notification.
