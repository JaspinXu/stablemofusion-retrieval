A figure side steps first to the right and then all the way to the left before ending back in the centre, subsequently a person walks from the middle to one side, then starts to turn around to walk to the other side until they reach it. After that, they turn back around to walk down to the other side one last time, again passing through the middle and then turning around to stop.
