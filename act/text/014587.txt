A person is side stepping to the right and then to the left while facing forward. Subsequently, they view their phone in their hand and use a sliding motion with their finger to answer a phone call. They then hold the phone up against their face, slightly rotating counterclockwise and clockwise while switching their weight from the blue side to the left side during the conversation, possibly feeling irritable. After the conversation, they drop their arm and hold the phone for a brief moment until putting it back into their pocket. Later, they withdraw the phone from their pocket to look at an incoming notification.
