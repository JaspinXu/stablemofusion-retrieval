A person walks forward, puts their left hand down on a table, and uses their right hand to reach over the table and grab an object. Subsequently, a man picks up another object from the ground using his right hand, then his left hand, and after keeping his left hand near his stomach, he exercises with his right hand. Later, he puts the object back on the ground using his left hand, and then again with his right hand.
