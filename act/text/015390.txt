A man stands in the center, then walks to the left and stops, lifting both hands to shoulder height on the left. After that, he walks forward to the right towards the center, hops forward, crunches from the waist while standing, and then walks backwards from the center towards the right. Meanwhile, a person jogs in place, jogs to the right, jogs to the left, and then returns to their original location.
