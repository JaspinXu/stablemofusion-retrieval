A person who is initially standing with his hands by his sides steps back, then takes three steps to his left. After that, he turns 180 degrees and walks four steps, subsequently turning 180 degrees again to walk two more steps, and then faces forward. Later, another person who begins standing with his hands out from his sides turns to his left and jogs a few steps. Following this, he turns 180 degrees and jogs back in the opposite direction, then turns 180 degrees again to jog in another direction, and finally turns 180 degrees once more to jog a few more steps before stopping and resuming his initial position.
