A person is moving their left arm in a circular motion in front of them as if they are stirring a pot; then, following that, another individual who is standing with his hands down by his sides steps back, bends over, gets down on his hands and his knees, crawls, and subsequently stands back up, walking back two steps to return to his original stance.
