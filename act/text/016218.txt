The figure appears to be ballroom dancing by themselves, notably with their hands down and their neck turned to look at their feet as they take steps that outline a square, with their feet apart and then together. Subsequently, they move back and together before turning out of the square and starting the pattern again. Following that, a person moves forward quickly, spinning while twirling their arms above their head, adding a lively energy to the dance.
