A person begins in a standing position, then picks an item out of their left pocket with their left hand. After that, they hold the item with both hands and raise their left hand to head height. Subsequently, a man, starting from a standing position, reaches out with his right hand to grasp something nearby at waist height. He then steps forward a few steps and extends his right hand out before returning it to his side.
