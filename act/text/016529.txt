A person walks on uneven terrain, then lowers his left arm from the head area down to his side. Next, he raises his right forearm up in front of him and then down again. After that, he uses both arms and hands in an up and down motion as if climbing a pole very quickly before putting them back to his side. Subsequently, the person bends forward at the hip, followed by raising both arms to the head area as if confused. Finally, he takes both hands and moves them towards his head and then out and forward, as if taking off something on his head.
