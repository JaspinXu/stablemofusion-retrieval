The person lowers his left arm from the head area down to his side, then raises his right forearm up in front of him and down again. Subsequently, he uses both arms and hands in an up and down motion as if climbing a pole very quickly before putting them back to his side. Following that, the person bends forward at the hip, and then raises both arms to the head area as if confused. Finally, the person takes both hands and moves towards the head and then out and forward, as if taking off something on his head. Meanwhile, someone else leans on the wall nearby.
