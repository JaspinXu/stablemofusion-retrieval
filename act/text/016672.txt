A man walks forward toward the screen, then turns to the right before returning to face forward. After that, he starts walking backward until he reaches his original position. Subsequently, he side steps to the right at a slight angle. Later, a person who had been lying on the ground with feet and hands spread wide apart uses both hands to push himself up into a standing position.
