A person stumbles forward and knocks his head against a wall, subsequently looking at his hand and discovering something such as blood. After that, he puts his hand down and then back up again, acting as if he was dumb for knocking into something. Later, another person standing nearby recoils from a blow to the face and places their hand to their face in reaction, checking their hand for any bleeding.
