A person walks in a clockwise circle with their arms and hands above their head; then, the right hand moves in a clockwise, reeling motion. Subsequently, both hands move upwards a bit before culminating in a patting motion like making a snowball. After that, the right hand throws forward in an overhanded motion, and the sequence concludes with the hands coming back to rest at the abdomen.
