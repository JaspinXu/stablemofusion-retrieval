The right hand moves in a clockwise, reeling motion, then both hands move upwards a bit before culminating in both hands patting in a snowball-like motion. After that, the right hand throws in an overhanded motion forward, and the motion ends with the hands coming back to rest at the abdomen. Subsequently, the person holds their hands in front of their body at head level and kicks with the left foot repeatedly.
