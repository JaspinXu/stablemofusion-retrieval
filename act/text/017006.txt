Facing stage front, a stick figure is standing in a t-pose with their arms out by their sides. Then, they drop their arms, leaving the left arm dangling while the right hand comes up to caress where their face should be. Following that, the stick figure lowers its right arm and shoulders. Subsequently, the person throws a ball with their right arm three times.
