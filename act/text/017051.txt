A person places his hands on bent knees, sways back and forth, then stands and walks backwards. Following that, he bends over as if gripping his chest with his left hand while his right arm swings listlessly. Holding this position, he takes three steps forward. After that, he changes his trajectory, turning approximately 45 degrees to his right while maintaining the bent-over position and still gripping his chest. He then takes six steps forward in his new direction and appears to wave someone for help with his right arm lifted above his head.
