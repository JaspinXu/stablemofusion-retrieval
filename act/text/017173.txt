The figure motions its upper body, bending towards the right and then returning to face the center, followed by bending towards its legs. Then, it twists toward the left. Subsequently, the person bends at the waist, lifting the left arm while allowing the right arm to swing freely. After that, they lift up again, bending once more to raise the right arm, while the left arm continues to swing freely like a pendulum.
