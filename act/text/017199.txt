A standing person is exercising by twisting, bringing opposite knee to elbow and touching opposite hands to toes. Then, a man starts off like he is holding a baby in his arms and rocking them. Following that, he puts his arms out as if to say "what," and then pumps his fist on his chest where his heart is. After that, he resembles someone shooting a bow and arrow. Subsequently, he repeats the "what" gesture and the fist on the chest. Finally, he raises his right hand to his mouth as if he is going to drink something.
