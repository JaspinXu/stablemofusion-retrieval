A person is using their right hand for expression during a conversation by gesturing for someone to come closer, extending their arm straight out, then bringing it back towards themselves. Following that, the individual continues to express themselves while walking a couple of paces before climbing up two steps, maintaining the same direction. Next, they climb down two steps and walk a further couple of paces before turning 180 degrees to return over the steps to where they started.
