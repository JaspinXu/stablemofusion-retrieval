A man walks side to side toward the camera, starting with his right foot, then moves in a counterclockwise circle. Following that, he walks back to where he started. After that, a person walks forward, turns, and jumps over an obstacle with his right leg first. Subsequently, he takes two steps forward, turns around, and then goes up one step.
