A character is facing forward at the front of the mat, then turns in a counterclockwise motion and walks in a crouching motion towards the back of the mat. Following that, another person turns counterclockwise and backs up, then sits down and leans back casually with their hands resting on their lap. After a few seconds, they stand up and walk to the left, turning right after a few steps.
