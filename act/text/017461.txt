A person kicks with their right leg twice and then quickly kicks once with their left leg. Following that, the figure steps at a diagonal angle, placing their right foot in front and then stepping their left foot behind. They repeat this side step, alternating the lead foot, and after completing the process twice, they shuffle and side step back to their original position.
