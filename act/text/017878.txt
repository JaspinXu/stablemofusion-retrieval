A person walks forward and to the right, then squats down facing forward, crosses their hands together, and subsequently stands to turn counter-clockwise. Following that, they squat again and place their hands on their knees. After this, the person puts their right hand on someone's hip and their left hand on someone's shoulder, swaying from side to side with their hips.
