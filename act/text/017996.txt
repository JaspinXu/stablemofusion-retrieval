A person is standing and leaning forward, using their hands to swat away some objects in front of them. Then, they stand up straight, raising their arms in a shrugging motion, followed by raising their right arm to wave. Subsequently, they hold their head with both hands and sway back and forth, before bending their arms and holding their hands to perform a swimming motion.
