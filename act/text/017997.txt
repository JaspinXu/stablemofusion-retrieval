A person stands and raises arms up in a shrugging motion, then raises the right arm to wave, holds the head with both hands, and sways back and forth. After that, he bends his arms and holds his hands to perform a swimming motion. Subsequently, he uses both hands in a pounding motion four times while moving backwards, and then skips forward again before turning to the right side.
