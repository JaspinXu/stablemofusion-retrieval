A person leans down to the left and reaches out with his right arm as if grabbing something, then turns to the left and makes another grabbing motion. Following that, he makes a buffing motion with his right arm as if cleaning off something he picked up. After that, he leans down once more with his right arm, then waves before turning around and walking away.
