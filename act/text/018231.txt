A person has their left hand up, trying to open something. Then, they turn around with their legs criss-crossed at one point and walk back down towards the bottom of the ramp. After that, they lean down and pick something up with their right hand and start walking back to the top. Subsequently, the person moves side to side with their arms extended, then raises them over their head, followed by moving their hands to their shoulders and leaning back with their right arm on their forehead.
