A person performs a waltz by themselves, then a man joins in by holding both hands up in the air, stepping forward with his right leg, followed by his left leg, then stepping back with the left leg and slightly to the right with the right leg. The man repeats this waltzing motion once more, synchronizing his steps with the rhythmic dance.
