A man standing raises his right hand three times close to his head; in the first round, he raises his hand at a slow speed, then in the second round, he increases the speed, and finally, in the third round, he raises his right hand very quickly compared to the last two rounds. After that, a person walks around in a circle before bending down to pick something up.
