A person sways to their right and left slightly before making the "cross" motion with their right hand, then brings both hands to their sternum in "prayer" formation. Subsequently, the same person stands still and looks to their left, then uses their right hand to touch their left shoulder, right shoulder, forehead, and stomach, ultimately ending with both hands in a praying position.
