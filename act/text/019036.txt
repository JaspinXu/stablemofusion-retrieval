A person raises their hands to chest level and moves them in a forward rowing position as if they were a cat pawing at a toy. Then, a man walks diagonally to the right, after which he bends down after two steps and touches the ground with his right hand. Subsequently, he takes three more steps and touches the ground with his left hand.
