A man is walking his dog when all of a sudden the dog jerks him to his right, and he tries to gain control by pulling on the leash. Following that, the man does small jumps to regain his balance, then executes a big jump, waits a few seconds, and finally resumes with small jumps before pausing and making another big jump.
