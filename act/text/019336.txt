A person walks forward, then turns around and walks back. Following that, they put their right foot forward while reaching up and to the right with their right hand. After that, they lower their right hand while putting their right foot back, subsequently raising their right hand to face level, lowering it again, and then raising both hands to face level before lowering both.
