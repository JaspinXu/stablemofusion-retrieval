A person slowly straightens, then turns back and to the right to pick up an object. Next, they walk forward and wipe something with the object. Following that, the right hand makes a sort of cross gesture twice, somewhat sloppily, going down from the head, then up to the left, across to the right, and then the gesture repeats.
