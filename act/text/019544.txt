A figure walks forward, then turns left, stoops, and reaches their right hand down. Following that, they turn and walk back in the direction they came from, stop, and move their right hand in circular motions while slowly turning around to face the front again. After completing these movements, the person continues by doing arm exercises and then walks forward.
