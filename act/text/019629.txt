A person mimics picking up a jump rope and moves his arms back to get ready. He then jumps a total of ten times, swinging his arms forward, alternating between arms apart and arms crossed. Following that, someone is laterally raising both their arms while slightly bending their knees, brings their arms back to their original position, and then raises them laterally once more.
