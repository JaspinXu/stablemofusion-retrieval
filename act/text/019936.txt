A person places her hands on her thighs, then drops to her right knee, next kneels and sits back on her heels for a moment. Following that, she leans forward, places her right foot forward, and then raises herself to a standing position while her left hand stays on her thigh and her right drops to her side. Subsequently, she kicks with her right leg a few times.
