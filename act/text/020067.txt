A person steps over a rope and jumps over it a few times. After that, they pause to move the rope behind them and then continue to jump rope some more. Subsequently, a man is slightly crouching as he lifts his right arm to his chest and then raises his left hand over his head, wiggling both arms. Following that, he stands up, turns slightly to his right, and walks forward.
