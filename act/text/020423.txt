A man slides to the side to dodge something, then goes back into place and slides to dodge again. Following that, a person skips forward to the right, leading with the right leg, while drawing the left arm forward in a rotating motion. Subsequently, the left leg slides forward as they throw an object with a discus-like motion, and then step back to the starting position.
