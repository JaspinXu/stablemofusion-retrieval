A person stands facing forward, then turns to the left and brings his arms down in a flexing motion. After that, he steps back to the first position and brings his arms up in a flexing motion, subsequently stepping to the right and flexing his arms down. Following this, a man slowly walks forward and then proceeds to dance in a circle.
