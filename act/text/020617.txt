A person washes or scrubs something with their left hand, then bends over to grab something in front of them with their right hand. After returning to pour some of it out, akin to soap or water, they place it back while continuing the scrubbing motion. Subsequently, the person moves backwards and forwards with their arms out as if they have wings.
