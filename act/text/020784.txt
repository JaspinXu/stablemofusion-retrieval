A figure is hanging onto a support with their left hand, standing on their right leg, and brings their left knee up slightly. Then, they kick back from the knee, hyperextend the left knee, and kick it forward. Following that, they pull the left leg behind the right while keeping the knee bent and kick leftward sideways with the heel, then relax the left leg. After this, a person walks forward and sits on something.
