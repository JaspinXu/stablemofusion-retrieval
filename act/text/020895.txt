The stick figure walks two steps forward, then turns left and continues walking forward. Following that, it curves to the right, ultimately creating a question mark pattern with its movement. Similarly, a person takes a few steps forward, then turns to their left, walks, and subsequently turns to their right. After that, the person walks in a clockwise circle before starting to walk back to their original starting point.
