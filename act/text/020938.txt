A person stands with their arms bent at the elbow, steps forward, and jabs outwards as if boxing. Then, they enter from the left, take a step down, turn to the right, step up, and turn counterclockwise while facing away. Following that, they step down, move one step forward, turn clockwise to face the side, and take one more step.
