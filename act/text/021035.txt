A person moves their arms from chest level to the sides of their hips, then rotates them in a circular motion around their chest twice, transitioning from an outwards to an inwards position. Following that, a figure shakes out his left leg and performs a single leg squat, then another with his right leg. After standing back up, he starts to jog in place.
