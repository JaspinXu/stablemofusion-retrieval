A figure turns and faces right before lounging on a low to the ground object; then, the figure stands and quickly turns towards the object. Following that, a person takes a couple of steps forward but stops in the middle of the second step, goes backwards two steps, and then moves forward until hitting something with their right arm and stopping.
