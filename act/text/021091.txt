A person stumbles forward and knocks his head against a wall, then looks at his hand and discovers something like blood. Following that, he puts his hand down and then back up again, acting as if he was dumb for knocking into something. Subsequently, another person standing recoils from a blow to the face and reacts by placing their hand to their face, checking for any bleeding.
