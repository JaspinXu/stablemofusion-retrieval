A person picks an item up from an invisible table and then walks to its right a few steps. Following that, he turns 180 degrees and grabs another item from an invisible table with his right hand while swirling his left hand. Next, he starts with his arms raised to the right, bringing his right hand to meet his left hand at his mouth. Subsequently, he spreads both hands out, looks to the left, and slouches down with both arms curved down. After that, he walks a full counterclockwise circle with a shambling gait, raises his arms above his shoulders, and makes another counterclockwise circle with the same shambling gait.
