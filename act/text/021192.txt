A person bends forward and appears to pick something up with their left hand from a low area about shin height. Then, they turn 180 degrees to walk a few steps in the opposite direction and subsequently turn 180 degrees again to return to where they retrieved the item. After that, they place it back in the same area but at the level of their torso, all the while slowly stepping forward and grasping their head in pain.
