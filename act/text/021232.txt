A person leans forward with their head facing down, swaying right to left before standing up and walking backwards. Then, the person is bent over as if gripping their chest with their right hand, while their left arm swings listlessly. Holding this position, they take three steps forward. After that, they change the trajectory of their direction, turning approximately 45 degrees to their left while still in the bent-over position and gripping their chest. They then take six steps forward in this new direction and appear to wave someone for help with their left arm lifted above their head.
