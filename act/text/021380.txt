A person is moving all around, shifting their body into many positions. Then, a man begins by pretending to hold a baby in his arms, rocking them gently. Following that, he extends his arms outward as if to express confusion, then firmly pumps his fist on his chest, indicating his heart. Afterward, he mimics the action of shooting a bow and arrow. He repeats the gesture of extending his arms and pumps his fist on his chest once more. Subsequently, he raises his left hand to his mouth as if he is about to drink something.
