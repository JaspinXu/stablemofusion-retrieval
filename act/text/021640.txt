A person walks forward slowly, then stands in one spot while stepping back and forth from one foot to the other with their hands held out in front of them, elbows bent at a 45-degree angle. Subsequently, they pick up the intensity, performing the same motion now jogging in place. Following that, they increase the intensity further, running in place before taking two steps back and crouching into a squat position.
