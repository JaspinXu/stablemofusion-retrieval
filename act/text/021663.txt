A person hops up while pushing a ball at eye level with both hands and walks backwards a bit, then launches the ball with the left hand using a long stride. Following that, the person hops forward only on the left foot, turns around while keeping the right foot off the ground, and hops back to the original point only on the left foot. Thereafter, the person settles both feet, turns around, and begins hopping forward solely on the right foot.
