A person hops forward only on their left foot, then turns around while keeping their right foot off the ground. After that, they hop back to the original point only on their left foot, settle both feet, and then begin hopping forward only on their right foot. Following that, they walk in a circle while using their left arm and hand in a clawing motion repeatedly.
