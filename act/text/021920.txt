A person quickly sits down on the left part of the room while facing right for a couple of seconds, then gets up and walks to the right part of the room. After that, he turns to face the left part of the room briefly before returning to his seat on the left part of the room where he faces the right side again. Subsequently, he begins climbing a ladder to reach for something to put away.
