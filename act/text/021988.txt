A person leans left to right and slowly bends over at the waist with arms hanging towards the front, then continues walking forward in a lumbering position while swinging their left hand and then their right hand out. After that, the person climbs down from a surface, turns 90 degrees to their left, and walks forward. Subsequently, they turn 90 degrees to their left again before climbing up on a surface, and then climb down once more.
