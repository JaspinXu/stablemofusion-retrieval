A man is standing up from the ground; first, he moves his right arm up and then in a circular motion. He then lifts his left arm up and moves it in the opposite circular motion to his right arm. After that, he squats down, pulls an object over his left shoulder and then his right shoulder, and subsequently walks in a semicircle.
