A person walks forward quickly, then skates down towards the bottom of the ramp, crossing their hands on their chest in an X. After jumping up and slapping something with their hand, they bounce backwards to the top of the ramp. Subsequently, they hold something with their hands and push it towards the side before jumping up again to shoot a basketball.
