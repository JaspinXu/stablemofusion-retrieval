A person stretches their left arm to the right shoulder, then makes a quarter turn to their left and stretches again. Following that, they make another quarter turn to their left and stretch once more. After completing these movements, the person bends down and touches the ground, hitting their head as they stand up. Subsequently, they move backwards to touch the ground again, seeming to hit their head once more.
