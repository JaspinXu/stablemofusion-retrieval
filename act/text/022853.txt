A person claps their hands, then walks to a chair and sits down before reaching for an object with their left hand. Following that, another person standing with his hands by his sides leans to his right, then leans to his left, raises his hands to catch something, tosses that something with his left hand, catches it again, and tosses it again with his left hand.
