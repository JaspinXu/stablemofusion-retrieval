A person walks in a clockwise circle, then faces forward and steps sideways with the right foot, followed by the left. After that, the person steps back with the right foot, and while the left foot follows, turns the body to face the left side of the room completely. Subsequently, the person takes a large step forward with the left foot while turning the body to face backward from where they originally started. Later, the person steps backward, turns the body again to face the right side, and then returns to face the front. All of these movements create a rectangular shape.
