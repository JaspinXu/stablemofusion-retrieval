A person lifts both arms from the side of their waist up, then moves left and right with their hip, and subsequently turns 70 degrees counterclockwise from the viewer. Following that, they take three steps with their right and then left foot before stopping. Afterward, the person brings both hands together to their chest as they step forward, putting all their weight on their right foot and using their left arm to make an overhead throwing motion. Immediately afterward, they make a larger throwing motion with their left arm and then step forward on their left foot before stepping backward to their starting position.
