A person is carrying something over their shoulder while walking in a circle, then breakdances by skipping backwards, drops one hand to the ground, pivots to his other hand and into a headstand, drops his feet back to the ground, flips over, raises one hand up, and finally bounces off his other hand to land on his feet.
