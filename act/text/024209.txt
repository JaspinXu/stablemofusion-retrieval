A person begins by bending his left elbow with his left hand in front and palm facing down, then puts his left hand back down. Following that, he bends both elbows with hands in front and palms facing down, moves his forearms from left to right twice, and then moves his left hand down and in front of him while his right hand moves down at his side. Finally, he places his left hand back down at his side before touching an object with both his hands.
