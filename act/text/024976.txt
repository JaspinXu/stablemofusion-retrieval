A person lifts their right arm above shoulder height, then lowers it and raises both arms above shoulder height. Following that, they lower both arms and subsequently lift as high as they can before bringing both arms back down to shoulder height. Meanwhile, a figure flexes his left arm above his shoulder while flexing his right arm below, forming a bodybuilder pose.
