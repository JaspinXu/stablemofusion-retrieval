A person spins their hands and bends down on one knee to hit something, then they perform a windmill swing with both arms in a vertical motion back and forth while lunging forward. While lunged, they move their hips back to rest on their back foot, simultaneously swinging their left hand behind their head while keeping the right hand in front of their face.
