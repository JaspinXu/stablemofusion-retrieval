A person raises their hands above their heads, then rotates their torso side to side, stretches side to side, and subsequently stretches back and forth. Following that, a standing man performs a rolli polli with his hands in the air, then engages in a basketball dribble action, and finally moves his left hand towards his right hand back and forth.
