A person raises their arms out to their sides, lowers them back down, and then leads with their left arm and leg to get down on their hands and knees; thereafter, they raise up and stand on their knees. Following that, they stand with their left hand raised over their head, bent at the elbow, and then extend both arms out to the side.
