A person brings both arms up into a T shape and then puts them back together before dropping them down. Subsequently, they walk forward using both their left and right hands for balance, pressing them down on something to assist. They then place their right foot directly in front of their left and follow with their left foot in front of the right. Finally, they stop walking and stand still.
