The person picks something up and tilts to the side. Then, they set it back down. Following that, the person raises their right arm as if throwing something light into the air. Afterward, they return to center and pick up an item with both hands, bringing it up to the right side and then back down across to the left side of the waist. Subsequently, their arms reset to center and hang by the waist, before they proceed to pick up an item on the right and turn to the left to put it down.
