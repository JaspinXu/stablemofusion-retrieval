A person is standing, swinging both arms back and forth, then walks backwards and stretches their left arm by imitating a throwing motion. Following that, the person stands on their left leg in one spot, raises their left hand to create a fist, and then, while remaining in the same position on their left foot, lightly and slowly flaps their arms like a bird.
