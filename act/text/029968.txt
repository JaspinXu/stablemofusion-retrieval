A person standing up throws something forward from above their head, then throws something again forward with more force, which makes them take one step forward with their left foot. After that, the same person is seen bent over with their arms around a dog, bouncing around playfully. They let the dog stand up and pet it, followed by allowing the dog to sit down. Subsequently, they look around and lift the dog up momentarily before putting him back down to his original position.
