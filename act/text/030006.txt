A person thrusts their left leg forward in a lunge three times while simultaneously extending their upper body forward three times. Then, they lift their left leg, grabbing it with their left arm, and place their left foot on their right thigh. Following that, they return to a standing position and lift their right leg, grabbing the right foot with their right hand.
