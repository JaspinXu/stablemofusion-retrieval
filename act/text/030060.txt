A standing person first puts both of their hands on their hips, then kicks out their right leg, raises both hands in the air above their head, and finally waves their right hand, palm down, in front of them. Following that, the person spins their hand in a circular motion while waving it, then moves their elbow in a circular motion, subsequently moving their waist in a circular motion, and finally kicks with their right and left foot.
