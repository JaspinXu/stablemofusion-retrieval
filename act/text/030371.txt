A man touches his upper left arm with his right hand, then reaches the right hand forward, and subsequently touches his right hand to his left shoulder. After that, he reaches the right hand forward again before lowering it to his right side. In the meantime, a person plays the air drums while standing, starting with the center drums, moving to the right, and then all the way back to the left.
