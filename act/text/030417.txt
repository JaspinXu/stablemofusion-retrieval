The person is balancing on his right foot, then the right foot moves slightly more to the right, causing the arms to jerk a little. After that, the right foot shifts again and turns the whole body a quarter way counterclockwise before stopping to adjust the left foot as well. Subsequently, the body is in a stance as if looking at something nearby on the left. Following that, the whole body turns towards the right and holds its hands together.
