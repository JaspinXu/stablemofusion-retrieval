A person moves their right foot in front to the side and then shifts their left foot, leading their body to stand side on the opposite side of a square. Following that, a man walks forward for a short distance, turns slightly to the left to return to his starting point, and then continues forward for a short time before turning right, ultimately creating a figure 8 pattern as he heads back to his starting point.
