A person raises their left arm as if throwing something light into the air, then returns to center and picks up an item with both hands, bringing it up to the left and then back down across to the right side of their waist. After resetting their arms to center, they hang by the waist and proceed to pick up an item on the left. Subsequently, they turn to the right to put it down, then walk forward. However, when they try to turn, they twist their ankle, prompting them to stretch their left ankle, but eventually, they stumble.
