A person walks with both legs spread out, then puts their blue colored hand up and moves slightly forward on the blue colored leg, lightly bending the knee. Next, the red colored leg moves backwards, bending its knee, while both hands rise above the head. Following that, the person leans forward and forms their hands into a circle.
