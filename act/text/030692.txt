A man walks unsteadily forward, then turns around and walks back. Subsequently, he stretches his left shoulder by bringing it back and rotating it, then switches to his right shoulder, bringing it back twice and rotating it twice. Following that, he moves to warming up his elbow joint by bringing his hand to his shoulder and then extends it fully while turning his inner arm outwards.
