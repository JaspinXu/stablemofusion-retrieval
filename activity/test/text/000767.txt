A person is standing up straight with their arms stretched out. They then bring both hands toward their face simultaneously. This movement involves rotational motion as their arms rotate around the shoulder joints. Most human motion involves a combination of translatory motion, such as when a long jumper sprints toward the sandy pit, and rotational motion, like the movement of bringing hands towards the face. The long jumper exhibits translatory motion as he runs in a straight line before his jump.
