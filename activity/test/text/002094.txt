Someone walks up to pick something off the floor, then a man begins with his feet together and his hands by his side. He jumps in the air, bringing his hands together above his head while spreading his feet out to shoulder width. Following that, he holds his arms out to his side, parallel to the ground, then resumes his original position and goes again.
