A man begins with his feet together and his hands by his side. He jumps in the air, brings his hands together above his head, and spreads his feet out to shoulder width. Then, he holds his arms out to his side, parallel to the ground. Following that, he resumes his original position and goes again. After that, he walks forward slowly.
