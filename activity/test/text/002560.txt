A person who is standing with his knees bent and hands on his thighs reaches up with both arms, then holds his left arm up while his right arm drops. Following that, he drops his left arm and lifts both arms out from his sides again, as it appears he is lifting a box onto a shelf and grabbing another box to put on the shelf as well.
