A person who is standing with his arms extended at shoulder height drops his hands to his knees and holds that position before raising his arms to his original position. Subsequently, with the right arm bent and facing up, the left hand high in the air and the right foot out, he brings his arms down and foot forward. After that, the person bows and moves his arms outward.
