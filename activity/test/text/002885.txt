A person standing up squats down by bending both knees slightly outward and raising both of their arms above their head simultaneously. Then they stand up straight and complete the motion one more time. Following that, a man does a workout where he takes a jump with his hands at his sides, raising them up in the air before returning to his normal position. He repeats this action six times.
