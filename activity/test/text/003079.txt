A person uses a reaching motion with their right arm, then brings their hands to the middle and extends their arms outward and horizontally twice. Following that, they duck down to walk underneath a bar or fence in front of them. After that, they turn left, walk around something, and then turn left again to climb up a ladder or similar structure.
