A man starts off in an upright position with both arms extended out by his sides, then he brings his arms down to his body and claps his hands together. After this, he walks down and to the left, where he proceeds to sit on a seat. Meanwhile, someone else holds their heads in their hands and bends to the left, trying to dodge something.
