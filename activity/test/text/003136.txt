A person brings their left foot up to both their hands in front of them, then crouches down while touching that foot. After that, they bend their left knee and touch their foot with their left hand. Following this, they place their hands on their chest with elbows out to the side, flapping their elbows several times. Then, they turn slightly to the right, wiggle to the left side, and subsequently wiggle to their right side, repeating the elbow flapping motion.
