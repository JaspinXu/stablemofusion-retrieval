A person practices karate by striking with their hands and kicking with their legs, then transitions into dancing by moving their arms in a circle while alternating kicks with their feet. Following that, they step to the right a few times, jump to the right, kick the left leg behind them, and then jump to the left to kick the right leg behind them.
