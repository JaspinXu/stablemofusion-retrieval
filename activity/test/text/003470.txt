A person grabs something in front of them, then walks away, but decides to walk back to return it and picks it back up again. After that, they begin to walk away once more. Subsequently, another individual jogs in a clockwise motion but falls to their knees. He then gets back up onto his feet and walks to the right in a crooked line.
