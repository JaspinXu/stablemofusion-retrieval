A man stands straight with his feet not moving, then hinges at the waist to reach down to his feet. Following that, he puts his arms up, bent at the elbows, and twists his torso to the left and then to the right. After facing forward, he leans over to the left and then to the right, stretching. Subsequently, the man walks in a clockwise circle while holding something at his left shoulder.
