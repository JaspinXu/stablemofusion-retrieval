An individual is standing still, raising their fists to make a rolling motion. Then, they raise their fists up to their shoulders and shake them. Subsequently, they place their left arm at their side. Following that, the person rolls their arms as if boxing, lifts their arms as if celebrating, and pushes off to the sides.
