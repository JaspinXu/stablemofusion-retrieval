A man turns to his left, walks forward, and reaches out for something with his right hand. Subsequently, he turns around counterclockwise, walks back, and then turns once again counterclockwise to walk. Meanwhile, a robot stands on its left leg with its right hand uplifted, moving its leg in different positions.
