A person puts their blue-colored hand up and moves slightly forward on their blue-colored leg, lightly bending the knee. As the red-colored leg moves backward and bends that knee, both hands rise above the head, and the individual leans forward, forming a circle with their hands. Then, the person's high hands are dropped down, and they clap once before proceeding to walk up and take a seat.
