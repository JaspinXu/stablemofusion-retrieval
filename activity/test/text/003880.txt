A man sidesteps suddenly to his left, bumps into something, and leans over; then, he looks around and walks to his left, bumping into something else and once more leaning over. Following that, a person uses a reaching motion with their left arm, then brings their hands to the middle and extends their arms outward and horizontally twice.
