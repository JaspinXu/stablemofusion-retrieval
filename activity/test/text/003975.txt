A person makes an underhanded throw with his left arm, as if rolling a ball, before raising both arms into the air as if throwing a ball. Then, he takes two steps back and runs forwards quickly. Following that, a man walks forward two steps and kicks his left leg and foot into the air two times in a row. After that, he walks backwards two steps and pauses, followed by walking forward two steps and kicking into the air with his right leg and foot.
