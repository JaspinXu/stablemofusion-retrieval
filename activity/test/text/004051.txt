Starting from their right foot in the air, a person stands ready with fists up and then takes two swings with their left hand downward. Next, they swing two more times high and to their left, followed by two rights downward mirroring the lefts from before. After that, another person who is standing with his arms out and level with his shoulders drops his arms and swings his left arm forward four times. Subsequently, he swings his left arm backwards four times and stops.
