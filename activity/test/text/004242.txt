A person steps forward, then turns clockwise and walks back. After that, they squat down and pick something up with their left hand. Subsequently, they turn clockwise again, toss the item over to their right hand, and walk back. Following that, they start with their right arm above their head, looking at their hand, then lift their left shoulder and look at it. Later, they lift both their right and left hands above their head, looking back and forth between them.
