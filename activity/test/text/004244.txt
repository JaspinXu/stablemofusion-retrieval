The figure starts in a squatting position, then waves with its left hand and moves it in a circular motion. Next, it lifts both arms into a defensive stance before dropping them back down into a resting position on its knees and remains there for the rest of the video. Following that, another person is seen dancing by putting their arms out in a t-pose while rotating their wrists, then subsequently moves their legs up and out one at a time.
