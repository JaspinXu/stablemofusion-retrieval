The figure picks something up with their right hand, then uses their left hand to pick up another object and pours it on top of the object on the right, shaking it over. Following that, the right object is lifted up to the face with the right hand. After this, a person steps around something and then sits down on the item, resting each hand on the corresponding thigh.
