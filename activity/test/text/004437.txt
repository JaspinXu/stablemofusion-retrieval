A person looks at the ground and steps forward, then moves arms in a counterclockwise circle. After that, he looks down and centers himself, jumps twice while moving his arms in counterclockwise circles, and subsequently turns to the left to stretch his arms above his head. Finally, he waves his hands up and down before walking around.
