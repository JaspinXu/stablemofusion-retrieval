A standing figure raises both hands, palms outward, in front of his shoulders, then puts his right foot forward and extends his left arm outward as if pushing. After that, he puts his left foot forward and repeats the motion with his left hand toward his right. Following this, he resumes his original position, while subsequently, a person slowly walks backward, raising their hands up.
