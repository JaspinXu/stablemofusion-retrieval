when you are writing something imaginative – such as a story or an account of an interesting personal experience – you can make your writing more effective by including detailed descriptions of people and places. to write effective descriptions, you need a clear picture in your mind of who or what it is that you are setting out to describe. doing this allows you to focus on precise details which make the descriptions come alive in the reader’s mind.good writers incorporate descriptive passages into the overall piece of writing rather than write descriptively for the sake of it. a good rule to follow in writing descriptions is to base what you describe on your own experiences. this doesn’t mean that writers always describe exactly what they have seen or people they have met, but that they use their real life experiences as a basis for their descriptions and then develop them from there
