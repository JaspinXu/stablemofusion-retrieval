A man is jumping, with his arms at his sides and his legs straight. Then, his arms move up straight and outwards, with his hands forming a V shape over his head, and as he jumps, his legs move apart into an inverted V shape. Following that, a person throws a left punch and subsequently delivers a right kick.
