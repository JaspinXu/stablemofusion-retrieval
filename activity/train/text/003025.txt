A person is dancing, moving their right foot to the right and kicking out to their left with their left foot while swinging their arms out and in again. Then, they move both arms to their left and raise them up and around, subsequently bringing them back down again, finishing with some steps. Following that, the man extends his left arm up and grabs something from a shelf.
