An individual is dropping their arms down to their sides from a "t" position, then with their right hand, they reach left and back to the right. Following that, they reach up with their right hand, then down, and subsequently forward, bringing the arm back to the body. After that, the upper body turns quickly to the left, causing the arms to bounce from the movement.
