A person stands with their hands together but not touching at the tops of their legs. Then, they move their hands in a clockwise motion above their head before bringing them back down in a counterclockwise motion. After that, the person launches into a run, moving forward but to the left. For a moment, they stand stationary with their arms at their sides, and then suddenly step sideways to the left.
