A person stands on one leg with the other leg bent at the knee and held high to the right; then, they move it to the front and extend the lower leg. Subsequently, the person brings their right and left arms to the sides to make a scratching motion, then moves their arms up to the head for a scratching motion on both sides, with the right arm finishing scratching first, followed by the left.
