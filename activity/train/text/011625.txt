A person sits down with their legs crossed, pauses, then stands back up to their original position. Following that, the person takes a sip from two cups with both hands, then turns 90 degrees to his right before sipping again. After that, he turns another 90 degrees to sip from the two cups once more, ultimately facing the exact opposite direction from his starting position.
