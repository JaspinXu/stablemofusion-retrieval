A person steps back on his right foot while throwing his right arm forward, then steps back on his left foot while throwing his left arm forward. Following that, he steps back on his right foot and kicks his right foot forward, eventually stepping back on both feet while standing with arms spread out to the side, making a hand gesture with his left hand.
