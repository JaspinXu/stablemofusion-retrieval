A man walks towards the right with his hands at his sides slightly bent, then he turns around to walk in the opposite direction. Next, a person looks to their left and reaches out to grab something with their left hand. Still holding the object in their left hand, they then appear to unscrew the object's lid with their right hand. Following this, they raise the object to their head with the left hand, tilt their head back, and make a drinking motion. Finally, they lower the object and proceed to put the lid back on it.
