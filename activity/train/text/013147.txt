A man drops his arms suddenly and then raises them more slowly along with his back. Following that, he holds his arms out and near his chest before raising his left arm to pound at the air in front of him several times. Then, he is lying down on his left side; pushing up with both hands, he stands up into a squatting position and lifts his right arm up to his head before standing straight up.
