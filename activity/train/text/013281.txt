A person begins by stretching, wrapping one arm around the other while extending the stretching arm out to the side. Following that, he walks forward with his left hand outstretched as if carrying something. After stopping, he makes a motion as though putting something on a counter, and then proceeds to walk back to his starting position in a clockwise direction.
