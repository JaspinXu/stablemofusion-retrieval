A person stands with his arms to his sides, then crouches and jumps up with his hands above his head. After that, he crouches and jumps again with his hands above his head, then crouches and jumps once more with his hands held high. Following that, he pauses briefly before leaping up again, while simultaneously moving his hands in and out.
