A person takes a few steps forward, bending their knees as they prepare to execute a basketball move. Next, they perform a fake out by stepping back, followed by shooting the basketball with their arms extending forwards. After that, they drop their hands and take a few steps back. Subsequently, the individual then moves five steps forward on a narrow platform, holding up both arms for balance.
