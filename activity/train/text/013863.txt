A man walks in a straight line with arms outstretched as if on a tightrope; then he pivots back to the right with arms bent at the elbows, steps forward, and pivots again. Following that, he turns forward and steps back, shifts weight to his left foot, bends his body to the left, kicks back with his right foot, puts his right foot down, bends his right knee to the left, and then moves his left foot out.
