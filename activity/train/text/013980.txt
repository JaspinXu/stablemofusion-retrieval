A person moves both arms in a certain rotation, then bends both arms backwards in a stretching motion. Following that, a dancer with arms raised and spread steps away from the viewer, gracefully bowing, and then raises their left arm. Next, both arms are raised as the dancer performs ballet steps and a single pirouette, culminating in a leg dip up a ramp.
