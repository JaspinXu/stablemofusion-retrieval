A person squats with their knees bent outward and both arms raised out to the sides; then they lower both arms, resting them on their knees. Following that, they take three steps to the side, crossing their right leg before their left on the second step. After a brief pause, they take three steps in the opposite direction, this time crossing their left leg behind the right on the second step.
