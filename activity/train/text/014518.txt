A person is viewing their phone in their hand and uses a sliding motion with their finger to answer a phone call. They then hold the phone up against their face, slightly rotating clockwise and counterclockwise while switching their weight from the blue side to the right side during the conversation, maybe feeling irritable. After the conversation, they drop their arm and hold the phone for a brief moment until they put it back into their pocket. Subsequently, they withdraw the phone from their pocket and look at an incoming notification. Following that, a man runs in a clockwise circle.
