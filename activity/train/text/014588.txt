A person is viewing their phone in their hand and uses a sliding motion with their finger to answer a phone call. They then hold the phone up against their face, rotating slightly counterclockwise and clockwise while switching their weight from the blue side to the left side during the conversation, perhaps feeling irritable. After the conversation, they drop their arm and hold the phone for a brief moment until they put it back into their pocket. Subsequently, they withdraw the phone out of their pocket to check an incoming notification, and then run carefully in a circle to the left.
