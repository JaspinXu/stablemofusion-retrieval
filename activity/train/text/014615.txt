A person first stretches with their right arm over their head, then with their left arm over their head, followed by raising both arms up and then bringing both arms down. Next, with their arms raised, the upper torso bends to the left, returns to the center, bends to the right, comes back to the center, and then bends to the back. Subsequently, they bend all the way forward until their hands touch the ground, and then rise back to a standing position.
