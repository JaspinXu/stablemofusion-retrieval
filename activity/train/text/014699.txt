A man is holding his arms up and out to his sides, then drops them down. Next, he lifts his right hand and moves it from left to right in front of him, then from his head to his waist and forward and back in a cross pattern. Following that, a person is hopping on one foot with their arms out and then switches to do the same on their other foot.
