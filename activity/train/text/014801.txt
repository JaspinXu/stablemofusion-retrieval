A person who is standing with his hands by his sides looks to his left, then steps back and sits down. After that, he stands up and steps forward. Subsequently, a man holds his arms up and out to his sides before dropping them down. He then lifts his left hand and moves it from right to left in front of him, followed by movements from his head to his waist and forward and back in a cross pattern.
