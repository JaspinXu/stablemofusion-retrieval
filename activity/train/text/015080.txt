A person is standing up and catches something using both of their hands, then throws something with their left hand above their left shoulder. Subsequently, they catch something else with both hands and again throw it with their left hand above their left shoulder. After that, the person perhaps uses a camera to take a picture, then bends down to get something or change a lens, only to realize they've forgotten it and slaps themselves in the head.
