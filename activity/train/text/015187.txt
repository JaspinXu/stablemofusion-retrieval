A person dances energetically in place by swinging alternating legs in front and behind themselves, with their arms lightly swinging at their sides. After finishing their dance, they walk to the right, then stand with hands at shoulder width and waist height, slightly in front of their body. Subsequently, they reach for something above and below with their right hand.
