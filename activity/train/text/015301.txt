A person walks forward, approaches a table, puts their right hand on the table, and leans over it. Following that, a man picks up an object from the ground using his left hand, then switches to his right hand. Afterward, he keeps his right hand near his stomach, exercises with his left hand, and then places the object back on the ground using both hands.
