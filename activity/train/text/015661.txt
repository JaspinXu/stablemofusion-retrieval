A person who is standing with his hands by his sides steps back, then takes three steps to his right, turns 180 degrees and walks four steps. After that, he turns 180 degrees again and walks two steps, subsequently facing forward. Later, another individual who initially has his hands out from his sides turns to his right, jogs a few steps, and then turns 180 degrees to jog in the opposite direction. Following that, he turns 180 degrees once more and jogs in the other direction, before turning 180 degrees again to jog a few more steps and finally stopping to resume his initial position.
