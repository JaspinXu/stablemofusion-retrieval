A person walks forward with their right arm slightly lifted and bent, then walks backwards while bending their arm downward at a 90-degree angle. After that, they spin around counterclockwise and walk forward again with their right hand out and bent. Subsequently, a man uses his left hand to open something in his right hand and brings the right hand up to his face as if he's drinking.
