A man slowly sidesteps to the right 4 steps, then sidesteps to the left 4 steps. Following that, this person walks as if pacing the floor nervously, first forward 4 steps at a slight angle, then turns a half turn to the left. After that, he crosses the space and turns a half turn right, then walks to the middle where he started and steps back slightly while turning to the left, or one quarter turn left from where he started.
