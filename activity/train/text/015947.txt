Standing forward, a body turns slightly backwards to the right, reaches toward the ground with his right hand, then brings it back up to his face, and then back down to the ground, standing forward again. Subsequently, while sitting, he takes an object out with his left hand, raises it to his head, before putting it away again with the same hand.
