A man walks forwards on the same spot infinitely, then steps forward and immediately backwards while raising and lowering his left hand. Following that, he slides to his left and turns 90 degrees clockwise. Afterward, he lowers into a squat position while moving his hands in and out from his body, and finally, he rises to a standing position.
