A figure is balanced on the left foot of a straight supporting leg, with the left arm extended, holding the right foot on a bent right leg with the right hand; the figure struggles with balance, hopping to its right, then left, and then bending its arm while extending its right leg before further bending the leg. Subsequently, a person crawls backwards on the ground.
