A stick figure waves, then steps and turns to the right while continuing to wave. Next, the figure steps to the left and continues waving. Following that, a person strides from the left to the right while lifting their arms above their head in the same motion. Then, they step forward to the left front, lift their hands above their chest, and twist from left to right.
