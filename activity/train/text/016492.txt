A person walks quickly forward, then kicks with his right leg twice, returning to the beginning position by running backwards. After that, he runs forward again, kicks twice with his right leg, and subsequently returns to the starting position by running backwards. Following that, he takes a moment to drink something and then opens what seems to be a can.
