A person steps out with their left foot and pushes forward with both hands, then steps back to the original position. Following that, the person steps to the side again, reaching out only with the left hand. After this, they shake it all out, stretching before an event, starting with their arms and hands, then moving to their legs, eventually loosening their hips, and culminating the routine with a squat before standing up again.
