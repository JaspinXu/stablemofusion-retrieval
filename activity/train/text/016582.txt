A robot stands up and throws something with its right hand, then celebrates with the same hand. Following that, a person takes a step forward and raises their left hand as if about to grab something, then turns back around and skips a step forward with their right hand raised in a similar motion. Subsequently, the person turns back again and performs a 360-degree circular turn.
