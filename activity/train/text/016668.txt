A person stands up with arms in front of his face, throwing punches with alternate arms while slightly moving his feet forward with each punch. Next, he adopts a boxing stance, raises his hands, throws a punch with his left hand, and then his right hand. After that, he slaps with his right hand and takes a step forward.
