A person steps forward, then turns around and runs in a semi circle clockwise. After that, they reverse direction to run back counter clockwise. Subsequently, they walk forward, reach with their right hand to shoulder height, and drop the hand. Following that, they wait a bit before reaching up again to take something and start turning to walk back.
