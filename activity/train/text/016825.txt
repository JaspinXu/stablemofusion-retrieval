A person bends over to inspect something, then grabs a vertical object with both hands and twists it with their right hand. After that, they let go and retreat, subsequently standing in place to rotate their arms alternately above their head and to the right. Following that, they swing both arms in unison over the back of their head, ultimately ending up with their hands in front and opened upwards.
