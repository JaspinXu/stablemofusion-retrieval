A man is getting up from lying on the ground, then walks in a complete clockwise circle. Following that, he lays back down in the same position he got up from. Meanwhile, a person turns to the left and walks a few steps; then they turn back around and start walking in the opposite direction, only to turn back and repeat the process.
