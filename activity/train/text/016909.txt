Someone standing with their arms out to their sides puts their arms down, then turns their body to the right, followed by a turn to the left. Subsequently, a person stumbles forward and knocks his head against a wall. Following that, he looks at his hand and discovers something such as blood, then puts his hand down and back up again, acting as if he was dumb for knocking into something.
