A person stands and moves their hands to stomach height, then taps the buttons on a phone. Following that, they raise their hands above their head together before bringing them back down to stomach height, using their right hand to push the phone buttons. Meanwhile, holding with their left hand, they adjust the buttons on their headphones with their right hand and then use both hands to put the headphones on their head.
