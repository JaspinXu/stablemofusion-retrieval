A person begins by bending their right leg at the knee with their foot behind them, then moves the leg around from left to right, straightening and rebending it. Following that, they walk backwards, lifting their arms up, then down, and back up again. After bending down and placing their hands on the ground, they perform a jump onto their knees. Subsequently, they stand up and take a step backwards.
