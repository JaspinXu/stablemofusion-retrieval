A person is bent over, gripping his chest with his left hand while his right arm swings listlessly. Holding this position, he takes three steps forward, then changes his trajectory by turning approximately 45 degrees to his right, still maintaining his bent position. After taking six more steps in his new direction, he lifts his right arm above his head, appearing to wave for help. Subsequently, he begins to act like a monkey.
