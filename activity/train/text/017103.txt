A person reaches out their right arm to pick something up and holds it to their ear. After putting the object back down, they pick up another item, holding it in front of them with both hands to examine. Subsequently, they bend over, letting their arms hang freely and occasionally raising their right arm in the air as if pretending to be an elephant.
