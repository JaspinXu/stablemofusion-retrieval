A man begins by holding a baby in his arms and rocking them gently, then puts his arms out as if to express confusion and pumps his fist on his chest over his heart. Following that, he mimics shooting a bow and arrow, repeats the expression of confusion, and again pumps his fist on his chest. Subsequently, he raises his right hand to his mouth as if to drink something. After that, he picks something up and throws it repeatedly.
