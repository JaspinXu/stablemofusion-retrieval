A person rotates 180 degrees to their left while taking a step backward. After that, they reach down with their right hand before bringing the hand up to their face, twisting slightly at the waist. Subsequently, they set the object back down with their right hand and turn to the left to face the original direction. Following that, the person seems to look around for something, then goes back to waiting and looks around again.
