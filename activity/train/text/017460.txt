A person starts by standing in one spot, stepping back and forth from one foot to the other with their hands held out in front of them, elbows bent at a 45-degree angle. They then pick up the intensity, jogging in place, and subsequently transition to running in place. Following that, they take two steps back and crouch into a squat position. Afterward, they kick with their right leg twice and then kick once with their left leg at a fast pace.
