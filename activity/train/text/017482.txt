A person hops up while pushing a ball at eye level with both hands, then walks backwards a bit before launching the ball with their right hand using a long stride. Subsequently, the person hops forward only on their right foot, turns around while keeping their left foot off the ground, and then hops back to the original point only on the right foot. After that, they settle both feet, turn around, and begin hopping forward solely on the left foot.
