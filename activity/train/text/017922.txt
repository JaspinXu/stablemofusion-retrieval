A standing person steps forward with their arms behind their back, then steps to their right side walking in a circle. Following that, they walk forward with another turn before walking forward once more. Next, they elevate both arms to chest level, sway their midsection to the right and left, and pick up their right and left foot in succession. After that, they crouch slightly, bending and elevating their arms to chest level with a bend at the elbows.
