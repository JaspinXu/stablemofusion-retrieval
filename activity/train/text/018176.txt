A man stands up with both arms at a 90-degree angle, hands in the air, and then twists back and forth at the waist to the left and right for 5 seconds. After that, he bends to the left at the waist towards the ground and then bends to the right. Subsequently, he walks slowly sideways to his right, turns, and then starts moving towards his left.
