A person walks around with frustrated gestures, then takes eight side-steps diagonally; on the second step, they cross the left leg over the right, on the fourth step, they cross the left leg behind the right, and on the sixth step, they cross the left leg over the right again. After that, the figure pauses before taking a side-step back the way they came without crossing their legs.
