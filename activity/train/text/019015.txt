A person starts by standing with their left arm straight out to the side while their right arm moves to put on a sleeve of a jacket. Next, the right arm extends out to the side, and the left arm reaches to put on the other sleeve. Subsequently, both arms move to the front of the body as if straightening the jacket. Following that, the person begins to dance to the right, raising their arms and bending at the elbows. Finally, they turn around and dance back to the left with their right arm held higher than the left.
