Someone moves their hips from side to side, then squats down and back up, kicking out their right leg and shaking it, followed by kicking out their left leg and shaking it as well. Subsequently, they squat back down and lift their arms, keeping them outstretched. In the meantime, a person continuously grabs something from their left side with their right hand and discards it to the side.
