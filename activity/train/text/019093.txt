A figure marches forward with their left elbow bent and hand raised at shoulder height. Then, the figure stops, turns around, switches arms, and marches back to the direction they came from. During this time, a person uses their right hand to reach for an item at waist height, then continues to reach above head height, and finally bends down to pick up an item from the floor.
