A person puts their right foot forward while reaching up and to the right with their right hand, then lowers their right hand and puts their right foot back. Afterwards, they raise their right hand to face-level, lower it, and then raise both hands to face-level before lowering both. Subsequently, a standing person readies and loads their gun into shooting position, then continues to shoot their gun, firing left to right in a sweeping motion.
