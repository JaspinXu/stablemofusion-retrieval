The person takes a small step to the side, then takes a step back, pivots, and turns like a dance. Following that, they take a step forward, then pivot and turn like a dance to step backwards once again. Then, they pivot and turn to take another step forward, afterward pivoting and turning to step backwards again, all while their arms remain in a neutral position. Subsequently, the figure moves somewhat jerkily, jabbing with the right arm before executing a fully extended punch. After that, they turn around jauntily and rotate back to face the previous direction before outstretching both their arms up.
