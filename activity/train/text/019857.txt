A man walks counterclockwise looking for something, and then a person breakdances by skipping backwards, dropping one hand to the ground, pivoting to the other hand and into a headstand. Subsequently, he drops his feet back to the ground, flips over, raises one hand up, and then bounces off his other hand and onto his feet.
