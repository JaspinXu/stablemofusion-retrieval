A man has his right foot on the upper thigh of his left leg, holding the pose with his arms out to his sides in the air for 3 seconds. Then, he drops his leg and switches to the same pose with his other leg. After that, he jumps low and then jumps high, subsequently waving his arms in an arc around his body.
