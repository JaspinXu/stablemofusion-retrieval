The figure appears to be ballroom dancing by themselves, notably with their hands not raised as if to indicate a partner and their neck downturned to look at their feet; they take steps that outline a square with their feet apart and then together, then back and together before they turn out of the square and seem to be starting the pattern again. Following that, a person moves forward quickly, spinning while twirling their arms above their head, adding a dynamic flair to the dance.
