A person raises up from a crouch, turns around clockwise, then takes a step forward. After that, they lean down and appear to move something on the ground with their left arm from left to right. Subsequently, they stand up left and take four steps forward. Following that, they draw a horizontal left-to-left line with their left hand, and then a vertical line. Finally, they pull something toward themselves and drop their hand.
