A person breaks into an enthusiastic dance, then balances on the right foot of a straight supporting leg, extending the right arm while holding the left foot on a bent left leg with the left hand. Following that, the figure struggles with balance, hopping to the left and then to the right, before bending the arm again and extending the left leg further.
