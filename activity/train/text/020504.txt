A person stumbles to the right, then turns around and walks while stumbling left. Following that, they turn around again and stumble a third time. Meanwhile, someone else walks with both of their arms in front of them as if they're searching through the dark, and then they turn counterclockwise to walk with their arms in front of them once more.
