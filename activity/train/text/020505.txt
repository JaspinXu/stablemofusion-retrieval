Someone moves forward slowly in a zigzag pattern with their hands up in a comical sneaking gesture. Then, the person takes 2 small steps forward, followed by 5 steps to the left. After that, they slow down to take a smaller, slower 10 steps, turn toward the back, and finally take 8 steps before stopping, now facing the back.
