A person leans right while adjusting something, then steps around to their left to touch it with their left hand. Subsequently, they start with their arms held out to the sides, step forward with their left foot, bend down to reach for an item with their left hand, retrieve the item and hold it with both hands, turn right, and steady the item with their left hand on top. After that, they walk forward, turn left, and bend down holding the item with their right hand while their left hand reaches up and makes repeated stroking motions towards the item held in their right hand.
