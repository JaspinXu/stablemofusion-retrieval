A person steps out with their right foot and pushes forward with both hands, then steps back to the original position. After that, the person steps to the side, reaching out only with the right hand. Subsequently, the person waves their arms, then moves their legs, followed by moving their torso and arms again, and finally crouches before standing back up.
