The person lowers his right arm from the head area down to his side, then raises his left forearm up in front of him and then down again. Subsequently, he uses both arms and hands in an up and down motion as if climbing a pole very quickly, after that putting them back to his side. Following that, the person bends forward at the hip and then raises both arms to the head area as if confused. Finally, he takes both hands and moves towards his head and then out and forward as if taking off something on his head, all the while someone is leaning on the wall nearby.
