A figure, facing east, turns first to the north performing a gesture with its left hand. Then it turns 180 degrees and makes the same gesture with the right hand before turning 360 degrees. Following that, a person climbs a ladder, pauses at the top, and holds on to the ladder. After securing his grip, he steps back down three steps, allowing his body to hang briefly. Subsequently, he climbs down the ladder and walks to the right.
