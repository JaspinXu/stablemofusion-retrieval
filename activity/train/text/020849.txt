A person stands up with his arms in front of his face, throwing punches with alternating arms while moving his feet slightly forward with each punch. Then, he assumes a boxing stance, puts his hands up, throws a punch with his right hand, and follows that with a punch using his left hand. Subsequently, he throws a slap with his left hand and takes a step forward.
