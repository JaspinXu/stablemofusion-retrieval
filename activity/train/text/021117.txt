A person walks in a circular path first with one object on their left shoulder supported by their left hand. After that, he picks up an object with his right hand and places it on his right shoulder, supported by his right hand. Subsequently, a man stands facing forward, stretches both hands forward, then turns left and walks a little before turning right and walking a little more, and then turns right again.
