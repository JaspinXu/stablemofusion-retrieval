A person is bent over, gripping his chest with his right hand while his left arm swings listlessly. Holding this position, he takes three steps forward, then changes his trajectory by turning approximately 45 degrees to his left while still maintaining his bent posture. After that, he takes six steps forward in this new direction and appears to wave someone for help with his left arm lifted above his head. Subsequently, another person, also bent over at the waist, walks towards the left, holding their right arm up towards their face, and then, while swinging their right arm, rear back and fist pump their left arm.
