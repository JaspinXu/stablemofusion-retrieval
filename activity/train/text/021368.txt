A person takes one step forward, swinging bilateral extremities simultaneously in a forward direction. Then, they turn 180 degrees, moving forward while swinging their arms in a backwards, circular motion. Following that, they face backwards, swing their arms, and step forward, ultimately walking back to the starting position.
