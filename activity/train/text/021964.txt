A man starts with his left arm up near his head, then lowers it so both hands are on his thighs. Next, he lifts both hands to chest level, shakes them, and returns them to his thighs. Following that, a person standing diagonally to their right first sways, then twists to their right, and finally steps and turns one hundred and eighty degrees with their right foot before returning to the previous position.
