A person appears to be stretching by rotating his core with arms raised; he continues to stretch side to side, arms still raised, and then bends at the waist to the floor. Subsequently, he simulates the action of a tennis serve by bringing his left arm down and up over his head while using his right hand to execute an upward throwing motion, and then he lands forward after the motion.
