A person starts with their left hand on their knee and right hand cradling their head, then goes from leaning to standing, drops both hands, cradles their head in the left hand, and bends over again. Following that, the person steps backward several paces while throwing their hands in the air out of frustration, then walks forward, shaking their hands in anger, and paces backward once more.
