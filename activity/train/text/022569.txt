A person has their arms outstretched as though they are around another person, and they waltz around in a clockwise circle. Next, a man holds both hands up in the air, steps forward with his left leg, then to the right with his right leg, steps back with the right leg, and slightly to the left with the left leg. Then, the man repeats this motion once more in a waltzing motion.
