A man is performing a happy dance, then he transitions into a handstand while doing leg scissors forward and backward, followed by jumping on his hands. After a brief fall, he quickly gets back up again. Subsequently, a person walks forward to the right, then moves back diagonally to the left, performs about face to the right, and finally returns to center while walking backward.
