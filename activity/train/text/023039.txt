A person stretches their hands and arms, then their back, and finally their legs. Following that, the figure squats or sits in a very wide, slouched position, remaining still for a couple of seconds. While holding that stance, the figure lifts their left hand (red side) and then brings the left hand to meet the right, vaguely revving before resting on their knees again.
