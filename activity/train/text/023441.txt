A person starts in a squat position with both hands on their knees, similar to a baseball/softball umpire behind the plate, and brushes their left knee for a few seconds. Next, the individual stands up, lifting their arms and circling them around one another before raising them toward something; they then look from right to left and move their elbows up from right to left.
