A man is walking his dog when all of a sudden the dog jerks him to his left, causing him to try to gain control by pulling on the leash. Following that, he pauses briefly before resuming his walk with small jumps, then a big jump, waits a few seconds, and continues with more small jumps before pausing again and attempting another big jump.
