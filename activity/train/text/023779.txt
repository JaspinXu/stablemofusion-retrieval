The person takes a small step to the side, then takes a step back, pivots, and turns like a dance. After taking a step forward, they pivot and turn to step backwards. Subsequently, they pivot and turn again to take another step forward, and then pivot and turn to take a step backwards once more. All the while, their arms remain in a neutral position. Following that, the figure performs a knockout turn around on their heel.
