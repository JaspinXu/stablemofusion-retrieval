A man faces the camera and stands in place, then turns his neck to look to his right, followed by turning his neck to look to his left, before returning to the starting position. Subsequently, he connects his hands together to lean right and then left, making a circular motion with his right hand, then with his left, before bringing his hands back together to complete a full circle.
