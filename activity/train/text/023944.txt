A person brings both hands together to their chest as they take a step forward. Next, they put all their weight on their right foot and use their left arm to make an overhead throwing motion, immediately following that with a larger throwing motion using the same arm. After that, the person steps forward on their left foot before stepping backward to their starting position. Subsequently, they wave their hand in a clockwise direction, then push an item away and grab something to move it closer to them.
