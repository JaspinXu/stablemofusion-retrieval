A person stands up and pivots on their right foot, turning in a counter-clockwise direction. Then, they raise their right hand to their mouth and put it back down next to their waist. Following that, they peer in a counter-clockwise direction with their neck elongated. After a few moments, the person seems to act like a bear and begins to scratch their butt.
