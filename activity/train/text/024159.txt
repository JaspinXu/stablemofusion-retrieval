A person stands and lifts both arms out to the sides, then drops them back to his sides. After that, he lifts them up to the front and draws circles going in opposite directions. Subsequently, he drops his arms back down and lifts them to the side again. Following this, a man is leaning backward while alternating his hands. Then, he stands up and walks a few steps before leaning back again.
