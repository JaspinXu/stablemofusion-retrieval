A man is slightly crouching as he lifts his left arm to his chest, then raises his right hand over his head, wiggling both arms. Next, he stands up, turns slightly to his left, and walks forward. Following that, a figure begins bent over at the waist, then stands up and to the left, repeating the gesture while flexing and stretching.
