A figure steps forward and then back again, one arm folded inward while the other extends in a dance. Subsequently, someone raises their left hand, and as they lower it, they move their right hand to their hip. Following that, they raise their left hand again before lowering it and then raising both hands, finally placing their right hand on their hip while raising their left again.
