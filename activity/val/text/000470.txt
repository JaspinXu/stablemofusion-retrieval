A person lifts their arms as if they're holding a guitar, then makes one strumming motion with their right hand before dropping their hands back to their sides. Following that, a man does jumping jacks, hopping while alternating between having his arms out and up and his legs apart, and bringing his arms down and bringing his legs in.
