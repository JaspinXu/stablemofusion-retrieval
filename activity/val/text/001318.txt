A person leaned on their hands and started to jump, then crouched down on all fours on the ground. Following that, they crawled sideways to the right, springing upwards with both hands. Subsequently, they shifted back to the left, then got up and took a step backwards. After that, they dashed forwards, fell back down on all fours, and finally fell flat on the ground.
