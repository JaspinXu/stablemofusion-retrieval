A person, while shrugging their shoulders, makes lateral movements to their left in a curvy-like fashion, then starts moving by swaying their shoulders to the right and stepping in that direction. They look down at their outstretched hands, take another step to the right, and glance at their hands once more. Finally, the person rhythmically steps to the right as if dancing.
