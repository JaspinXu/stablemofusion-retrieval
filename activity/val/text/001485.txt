A person starts moving by swaying their shoulders to the right, then stepping right. They then look down at their outstretched hands, step to the right, and look at their hands again. Finally, the person rhythmically steps to the right as if dancing. Subsequently, a man stumbles and hurts himself, resulting in a limp.
